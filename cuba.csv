Our reputation for unsurpassed quality, with both flavor and construction, has amassed a loyal following among cigar connoisseurs.\n\nIn 2012, the Fuente companies celebrated 100 years of hard work, dedication and family tradition. When the Fuente companies was established in 1912, Arturo Fuente would have never dreamed his passion for cigars would become a global benchmark for the cigar industry. He started his company with humble beginnings, rolling and blending cigars in the back of his house with his wife Cristina and two sons, Carlos and Arturo Oscar. Four generations later, the company is still family-owned and operated in the Dominican Republic.\n\nFrom the very beginning the focus of making a Fuente cigar was quality; quality tobacco, quality craftsmanship, and taking the time necessary to make a truly remarkable cigar. “We don’t hurry things; we just do things the way they are supposed to be done.” says Carlos Fuente Sr.\n\n100 years later, a burning passion for cigars continues to inspire the Fuente family. As they pass down to their children the culture and traditions of Arturo Fuente, the Fuente family will continue to make the world’s finest cigars for generations to come.",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,,"Cigars > Non-Cuban Cigars","Arturo Fuente, Cubanito, Dominican Republic, New Arrivals",,https://cigarsnstripes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cigars-1075.jpg,,,,,,,,,0,,Quantity,"Tin of 10, 10 Tins of 10",1,0,Country,"Dominican Republic",1,1,Brand,"Arturo Fuente",1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Newman launched Brick House; a true Cuban puro cigar made with the finest Havana tobaccos. To honor his family and heritage, J.C. modeled the Brick House label after his childhood home – the only brick house in their small, Hungarian village. Locals and visitors would gather at the house nightly to eat, drink, smoke and enjoy each other’s company. But with the Great Depression came the end of the Brick House.\n\nOver 80 years later, grandsons Eric and Bobby Newman relaunched Brick House using the most exquisite Nicaraguan tobaccos.

Because Cuba’s rich, fertile soil formerly created the most flavorful cigar tobacco in the world, Cuba was known as the Pearl of the Sea. Now, more than a century later, J.C. Newman Cigar Co. has recreated Perla del Mar, handmade in the J.C. Newman PENSA cigar factory in Estelí, Nicaragua. Today’s Perla del Mar is a rich and flavorful tribute to its original Cuban blend.</p>\nPerla del Mar features special, hand-selected, aged binder and long filler tobaccos from three distinct regions in the lush mountains of Nicaragua. This unique blend is combined with a smooth, creamy Ecuadorian Shade or hardy Connecticut Broadleaf wrapper to provide a complex, but balanced, taste.  Lastly, Perla del Mar cigars are box pressed to help the natural flavors of its unique tobaccos to marry together and deliver an extremely satisfying smoke.\n\n<strong><em>Boxes of 25 cigars</em></strong>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,,"Cigars, Cigars > Non-Cuban Cigars","Condega and Jalapa), Connecticut Broadleaf, La Reina, Mild-Medium, nicaragua, Nicaragua (Pueblo Nuevo",,"https://cigarsnstripes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Perla-Del-Mar-Cigars-Shade-Robusto.png, https://cigarsnstripes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Perla-Del-Mar-Cigars-Natural-Size-Chart.png, https://cigarsnstripes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Perla-Del-Mar-Cigars-Natural-and-Maduro-Wrapper-Promo-Limes.png",,,,,,,,,0,,Quantity,"Single Cigar, Box of 25 Cigars, 5 Cigars",1,0,Brand,"Perla Del Mar",1,1,"Ring Gauge Group","Large (50+)",0,1,"Price Level","Quality ($10-$15)",0,1,Country,Nicaragua,1,1,Length,"4 3/4",1,1,"Ring Gauge",52,1,1,Strength,Mild-Medium,1,1,Wrapper,"Connecticut Broadleaf",1,1,Binder,Nicaragua,1,1,Filler,"Nicaragua (Pueblo Nuevo| La Reina| Condega and Jalapa)",1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upmann Cigars</h3>\n\nHerman Upmann was a banker from Germany who so loved Cuban cigars that he moved to Havana in 1844 and set up as both a banker and cigar maker. His bank closed in the early 1920's but his cigars live on as a fine example of an elegant, light to medium flavoured Habano.  H.  Upmann's blend s composed exclusively of filler and binder tobaccos grown in the <em>Vuelta Abajo</em> zone.  Made using the <em>Tripa Larga, Totalmente a Mano</em> -  long filler, totally by hand technique",,,taxable,,0,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,,"Cigars, Cigars > Cuban Cigars","Cuba, h. upmann, h. upmann connoisseur, Parejo, Robusto","Restricted USA","https://cigarsnstripes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/H-upmann-Connonisseur-No-1-stick.jpg, https://cigarsnstripes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cigar-Chief-Humidor-H-Upmann.jpg",,,,,,,,,0,,Quantity,"Box of 25, Single, 5 Cigars",1,0,Brand,"H.

Wrapped in a hearty Havana Subido™ leaf, every cigar features a rich blend of Nicaraguan tobaccos carefully hand-rolled by master artisans. Aged in the mountains of Nicaragua, every Brick House cigar is a melding of flawless construction, superb quality and master blend.\n\nAn overnight sensation, the Brick House brand has become one of the most talked about cigars on the internet and a best seller nationwide.

A man who has worked with tobacco for as long as he can recall and his unconditional love and passion for it is obvious to all.\n\nThrough hard work and determination, he’s grown and processed tobacco to perfection throughout his tenure as a manufacturer and grower for the last few decades, and his factory Tabacalera Palma has been the home for outstanding cigars that have gained the love and appreciation of smokers all over the world.\n\nAs he calmly takes a slow draw from his caramel-like colored wrapped cigar, he realizes that everything is exactly the way he wants it. Staring fondly at a painting across his desk, he appreciates rollers in the factory nearly 80 years ago and a smile starts to reflect. In his mind, this is the perfect time to bring to life exactly what he’s looking at. It’s where it all begins, La Galera is where cigars are produced in a factory; it’s where the magic happens.

Newman’s fourth generation.\n\nAt our J.C. Newman PENSA factory in Nicaragua, Drew heard of an old style of rolling cigars from the factory’s general manager, Lazaro Lopez. Lopez runs the operation down at PENSA and his grandfather used to bundle cigars uniquely in 1940’s Cuba. He would bind the finished cigars together without any molds or presses. Rather, he would use leaves from the Yagua, a Cuban royal palm tree, to give these cigars a shape.\n\nThe cigars are rolled a little more wet than usual and once the humidity stabilizes, they take the shape of the other cigars inside the leaf. Every Yagua will have a slightly different shape. Packaged in a crate style box, these really give off an antique and rural appearance. A U.S.A. Connecticut Broadleaf wrapper incases Nicaraguan binder and filler tobaccos. Just like the J.C.

Basically, we stuck him in Nica for over a year at a bench and gave him the key to our tobacco and said: “Create a great cigar…” We gave him no boundaries or limits. Willy then spent forever working on this first blend… drove me a little crazy, made a lot of bad blends along the way, but I think we overwhelmed him a bit – I don’t think he was prepared to have so many tobaccos to blend from, rather daunting… our man Nicholas helped nudge him a little here and there and voila! Willy created something I consider great.\n\nAlong the journey, Willy has become an exceptional handmade cigar bunchero and rolero. Check him out when he is in a store near you!

Lopez runs the operation down at PENSA and his grandfather used to bundle cigars uniquely in 1940’s Cuba. He would bind the finished cigars together without any molds or presses. Rather, he would use leaves from the Yagua, a Cuban royal palm tree, to give these cigars a shape.\n\nThe cigars are rolled a little more wet than usual and once the humidity stabilizes, they take the shape of the other cigars inside the leaf. Every Yagua will have a slightly different shape. Packaged in a crate style box, these really give off an antique and rural appearance. A U.S.A.

Our reputation for unsurpassed quality, with both flavor and construction, has amassed a loyal following among cigar connoisseurs.\n\nIn 2012, the Fuente companies celebrated 100 years of hard work, dedication and family tradition. When the Fuente companies was established in 1912, Arturo Fuente would have never dreamed his passion for cigars would become a global benchmark for the cigar industry. He started his company with humble beginnings, rolling and blending cigars in the back of his house with his wife Cristina and two sons, Carlos and Arturo Oscar. Four generations later, the company is still family-owned and operated in the Dominican Republic.\n\nFrom the very beginning the focus of making a Fuente cigar was quality; quality tobacco, quality craftsmanship, and taking the time necessary to make a truly remarkable cigar. “We don’t hurry things; we just do things the way they are supposed to be done.” says Carlos Fuente Sr.\n\n100 years later, a burning passion for cigars continues to inspire the Fuente family. As they pass down to their children the culture and traditions of Arturo Fuente, the Fuente family will continue to make the world’s finest cigars for generations to come.",,,taxable,,0,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,,"Cigars, Cigars > Non-Cuban Cigars","New Arrivals",,https://cigarsnstripes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/arturo-fuente-belicoso-sun-grown.jpg,,,,,,,,,0,,Brand,"Arturo Fuente",1,1,Quantity,"Single, 5 Cigars, 10 Cigars, Box of 24 Cigars",0,0,Length,"5 3/4",1,1,"Ring Gauge",52,1,1,Wrapper,"Ecuador Sungrown",1,1,Binder,"Dominican Republic",1,1,Filler,"Dominican Republic",1,1,Country,"Dominican Republic",1,1,Strength,Medium-Full,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Carrillo Encore Majestic rated 96\n\n#1 Cigar of 2018 by Cigar Aficionado\n\nPerez-Carrillo, as a name, has been known in the cigar industry for decades. Ernesto, like his father before him, and all those even earlier have all been integrally involved in making cigars for generations. This is the inspiration behind the Perez-Carrillo Series of Cigars. These cigars are created from generations’ worth of knowledge, poured into unique blends, and which culminate as the creations of Ernesto Perez-Carrillo himself. Only these cigars are allowed to bear the name Perez-Carrillo and each vitola is an homage to someone within the family and celebrate the pride, joy, and cigars of the Perez-Carrillo history.\n\nErnesto Perez-Carrillo has roots that run deep throughout the Dominican Republic. When orders for his former brand, La Gloria Cubana, skyrocketed in the 1990’s, Ernesto could not meet demand with his small factory in Calle Ocho.\n\nAt one point, La Gloria Cubana’s Torpedo (rated a 93 by Cigar Aficionado in 1993) was in backorder for 12 months, and the need for a larger factory was obvious. He selected a site in Santiago, Dominican Republic to be his second factory.\n\nWhen time came to choose a location for the E.P. Carrillo factory, Ernesto knew exactly where it needed to be located. In April 2009, he signed a lease on a 40,000 square foot, stand-alone building in Santiago’s Zona Franca, and immediately began the construction of his dream factory, which he named Tabacalera La Alianza.\n\nHere is where the tobacco is fermented, aged, hand-made, and packaged under the supervision of Ernesto. Spread across 12 rolling tables, experienced cigar-rollers are in essence re-learning their craft as they are trained to roll cigars the “Cuban way” – the cigars are beautifully finished with a triple-cap method.\n\nErnesto Perez-Carrillo’s achievements have been driven largely by an insatiable desire to understand the intricacies of tobaccos from all over the world. “Each tobacco has its own character. You have to treat each tobacco differently and understand how they work together,” he says.\n\n<em><strong>Bundles of 10 cigars</strong></em>",,,taxable,,0,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,,"Cigars, Cigars > Non-Cuban Cigars","Dominican Republic, E.P.

A tough, stout, Cuban from the streets. He built a multi-million dollar company out of absolutely nothing except passion and hard work. The American dream. The first time I went to visit Espinosa was the first time I was ever in Hialeah Gardens. Almost all of my cigar shipments come from this area of Hialeah Gardens, Hialeah, and Doral. This is an area outside of downtown Miami that is 100% Cuban. It is like being transported to a different country in South America or the Caribbean.\n\nEspinosa Cigars Hialeah Gardens Limited Edition Aged 4+ Years: I started to think about how every cigar typically has the city name of Havana and Cuba. Then I started to think about the reality of it all. The cigars we smoke pass through this area more than anywhere else in the world. And I thought to myself, why the hell doesn't anyone call their cigar the Hialeah? So I asked Erik and he said why the hell would anyone do that? To which I answered, Because it's the truth. As much as we like to glamorize the old world and tradition, the truth becomes tradition. And the truth is that since about 2001 and beyond, Hialeah and Hialeah gardens have become THE cigar epicenter. Enjoy one of the better cigars you may have all year.

During these two years, Noel has really started to make a name for himself in the cigar industry, and I like to think that I had a small part in that. We've done some cool stuff together, like making unique blends on our YouTube channel and creating exclusive cigars that people just can't seem to get enough of. One of our big hits was the Peruvian Gold. My goal in working with folks like Noel is to make sure we both benefit from our collaborations. It's all about give and take, right? I believe this approach strengthens relationships and helps us both be more successful in what we do. Now, after all this time and work, I can't wait to sit back and enjoy this special cigar.

This is one of the best tobacco growers in Cuba to date. He not only helped set up the Montenegro farm (which is organic by the way; no pesticides) 8 years ago, he also brought all of his seeds from Cuba to plant initially. He shows up in Nicaragua twice a year to check on operations. He will first eat the soil. I'm not kidding. When they found the farm, he would walk around tasting the soil. This is how they know where to buy land. Incredible and crazy stuff here, people. This one cigar alone makes this month's box worth the opportunity to smoke it.

11022,variable,,,"Montenegro Batista Aged 10+ Years",1,0,visible,,"<h3>Montenegro Batista Aged 10+ Years</h3>\n\nOn the 26th of July, 1953, Fidel Castro invaded Cuba. On December 31, 1958, at a New Year's Eve party, the president of Cuba, Fulgencio Batista, told his cabinet and top officials that he was leaving the country. After seven years, Batista knew his presidency was over, and he fled the island in the early morning. Under Batista, Havana Cuba was the original Las Vegas casino town. It was run by the mob and fueled by gambling and all the things that come with that. There were millions upon millions of dollars coming in and out of Cuba, along with tourists from all over the world. This cigar band is in no way trying to disrespect any of the people who shaped the history of Cuba. This cigar band is simply a what-if. What if Batista had remained in power? The band was created under my art direction along with @sedatedhype. Our concept was Cuba remaining a Las Vegas style resort. Money, power, gambling chips. We wanted to take a traditional style Cuban cigar band like Bolivar and re-work it in the vintage neon casino style. We are in no way saying Cuba should have, or shouldn't have remained under Batista's rule. We are simply asking, what if? Would this be what traditional cigar bands look like? We wanted to put this band on the Montenegro cigar for a few reasons. The first being how classic the blend, style, and flavors of the cigar are. In my opinion, for a traditionalist out of Cuba working with otherworldly tobaccos, with Cuban classics in mind, you will not find a much better blend. The other reason is because of how decadent Montenegro is as a brand. The cigars are expensive. Pure. Traditional. And no expense is spared. I hope you enjoy this experience and maybe it will provoke some thought into the what-if. This is an 8 year aged Nicaraguan puro that was given to us for way less than it typically costs because of the support you offer Montenegro.

This goes back to around 1920. We will interview Christian Eiroa soon and get the breakdown. The Eiroa family owned Camacho cigars before selling to Davidoff in 2008. From what I'm told there was a non-compete agreement of 5 years that needed to be fulfilled until re-entering the cigar industry. That brings us to 2013. The Eiroa family open a new factory called Alladino (you have most likely heard of that brand named after the factory). This is one of two first blends they re-entered the market with. It sold for about a year before legal issues found it sitting in Honduras unable to be sold. This cigar you hold in your hand has been waiting to meet you.
