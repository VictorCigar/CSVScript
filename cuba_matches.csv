Our reputation for unsurpassed quality, with both flavor and construction, has amassed a loyal following among cigar connoisseurs.\n\nIn 2012, the Fuente companies celebrated 100 years of hard work, dedication and family tradition. When the Fuente companies was established in 1912, Arturo Fuente would have never dreamed his passion for cigars would become a global benchmark for the cigar industry. He started his company with humble beginnings, rolling and blending cigars in the back of his house with his wife Cristina and two sons, Carlos and Arturo Oscar. Four generations later, the company is still family-owned and operated in the Dominican Republic.\n\nFrom the very beginning the focus of making a Fuente cigar was quality; quality tobacco, quality craftsmanship, and taking the time necessary to make a truly remarkable cigar. “We don’t hurry things; we just do things the way they are supposed to be done.” says Carlos Fuente Sr.\n\n100 years later, a burning passion for cigars continues to inspire the Fuente family. As they pass down to their children the culture and traditions of Arturo Fuente, the Fuente family will continue to make the world’s finest cigars for generations to come.",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,,Cigars > Non-Cuban Cigars,"Arturo Fuente, Cubanito, Dominican Republic, New Arrivals",,https://cigarsnstripes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cigars-1075.jpg,,,,,,,,,0,,Quantity,"Tin of 10, 10 Tins of 10",1,0,Country,Dominican Republic,1,1,Brand,Arturo Fuente,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first third starts with cinnamon, mochas, vanilla, and toffee on the palate, and the retro is a red pepper zing with citrus. Holy moly! Further in the mouth feel is like a buttercream mint you get from a diner with butterscotch. It's sort of like smoking a vanilla mocha latte or something. The second third starts with apple pie flavors. Warmth and coating of the mouth. Cinnamon, artificial hazelnut, more mocha and vanilla. The retro has calmed just a bit but still similar to that amazing zing. In the final third, leather comes into the mix and it tastes like a churro. Sugar, cinnamon, light chocolate frosting, and at the very end I get a smoky peaty note.
